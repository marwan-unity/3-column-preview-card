## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my second chellenge on frontendmentor.io, and with the experience gained from my mistakes in my first challenge,
I tried to avoid those mistakes and aproach the project in a different way.

1. Sematic tags: main/article/h1/p
2. white-space: nowrap;
3. Centering the element with grid:
```css
.body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
